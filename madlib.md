As we have continued learning about software development, we have all at one
point asked ourselves two fundamental questions: first, "what language should I
learn next?" and second, "what text editor is best?". The first of these
questions is quite difficult; Python, C++, Java, etc. are all acceptable and
useful, so it can be difficult to choose -- in fact, the only truly repulsive
choice would be to use MATLAB. As to the second
question, the answer is quite simple -- VIM is quite clearly the
superior choice, whereas anyone who uses emacs brings dishonor and
shame upon themselves.
